# TIL

- 7 Sept: `tail -f` is awesome for watching log files, it automatically prints appended data to stdout
- 10 Sept: Setting "Key Repeat Rate" and "Delay Until Repeat" in the Mac keyboard settings to the shortest possible values makes Vim soo much nicer to use
- 11 Sept: `make` without any other arguments doesn't necessarily execute `make all`. It executes the first task of the Makefile. It's just the convention to put `all:` to the top
